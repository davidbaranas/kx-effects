Kevin Horden Memorial Synthesizer
=================================

This synthesizer is dedicated to Kevin Horden, who authored it with Karen Orton.

Karen Orton and Kevin Horden built a complete simulation of an analogue synthesiser using E-mu / Creative DSP hardware and kX driver.
Karen designed the voltage controlled filter (VCF) for the synth (potentially the most difficult component) and achieved a tracking of within a few cents - in other words, generally much better than most commercial analogue synthesisers.

Some notes from Karen attached below:

K-VCF.da is a precision voltage controlled filter. It tracks to a few cents of a semitone and allows you to put it very near resonance and play filtered noise with accurate pitch.

K-VCO.da is an oscillator. Both K-VCF.da and K-VCO.da have accurate exponential-to-linear converters base on polynominals.

There's doubtless a complete synthesiser in those file somewhere (I know - Kev used it at a few gigs). It is a question of whether someone wants to invest the time to get it going again. They wouldn't be disappointed!
